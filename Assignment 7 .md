# User Journey with LinkedIn

## 1. First Experience (Onboarding & Discovery)
I downloaded LinkedIn and was guided through a personalized onboarding on how to update my CV and connect with new colleagues.

The interface was intuitive, making it easy to navigate.

I discovered the daily newsfeed about my topics of interest.

## 2. Early Use (Building Connections and Applying to Jobs)
I started applying to jobs with features such as Easy Apply.

LinkedIn's algorithm recommended jobs that best fit my professional profile.

Seamless device switching (between phone, laptop, and tablet) made it extremely convenient.

## 3. Current Use (Loyalty & Daily Engagement)
I now use LinkedIn every day to get updates on my area and look for new opportunities.

Features like LinkedIn Learning have helped me increase my skills.
