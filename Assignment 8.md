# Data Engineering Pipeline Management Plan

## 1. Ownership Assignment
To ensure accountability and redundancy, we assign **primary and secondary owners** to each pipeline:

| Business Area  | Pipeline | **Primary Owner** | **Secondary Owner** |
|---------------|----------|-------------------|---------------------|
| **Profit**    | Unit-level profit for experiments | Engineer 1 | Engineer 2 |
|              | Aggregate profit for investors | Engineer 2 | Engineer 3 |
| **Growth**    | Aggregate growth for investors | Engineer 3 | Engineer 4 |
|              | Daily growth for experiments | Engineer 4 | Engineer 1 |
| **Engagement** | Aggregate engagement for investors | Engineer 1 | Engineer 4 |

- **Primary Owner**: Responsible for development, maintenance, and troubleshooting.  
- **Secondary Owner**: Provides backup support and assists when needed.

## 2. On-Call Schedule
A fair on-call schedule rotates evenly across the four engineers, considering holidays and workload balance.

- **On-call shifts last 1 week.**  
- **Rotation order:** Engineer 1 â†’ Engineer 2 â†’ Engineer 3 â†’ Engineer 4 â†’ Repeat.  
- **Holiday Adjustments:** If an engineer is on-call during a major holiday (e.g., Christmas, New Year's Eve), they swap weeks with someone else or have a backup engineer assigned.  

### **Example Rotation**
| Week | Engineer On-Call | Backup Engineer |
|------|----------------|----------------|
| Jan 1 - Jan 7  | Engineer 1 | Engineer 2 |
| Jan 8 - Jan 14 | Engineer 2 | Engineer 3 |
| Jan 15 - Jan 21 | Engineer 3 | Engineer 4 |
| Jan 22 - Jan 28 | Engineer 4 | Engineer 1 |
| Jan 29 - Feb 4 | Engineer 1 | Engineer 2 |

## 3. Run Books for Investor-Reported Metrics
For pipelines that report to investors (**Aggregate Profit, Aggregate Growth, and Aggregate Engagement**), the following run books are needed:

1. **Pipeline Overview**: Purpose, input data sources, transformation logic, and output.  
2. **Failure Scenarios & Resolutions**:  
   - **Data freshness issues** â†’ Check upstream dependencies, re-trigger pipeline.  
   - **Data inconsistencies** â†’ Validate against historical trends and logs.  
   - **Job failures** â†’ Debug logs, restart jobs, escalate if needed.  
3. **Monitoring & Alerting**: Define SLAs, dashboards, and alert thresholds.  
4. **Escalation Process**: When and how to escalate issues, including contacts.  

---

## 4. Potential Risks and Mitigation Strategies

### **Data Issues**
- **Late/missing data from source systems** â†’ Implement retries and alerts for late arrivals.  
- **Schema changes (new columns, datatype changes)** â†’ Set up schema validation and alerts.  

### **Pipeline Failures**
- **Compute resource limits exceeded** â†’ Optimize Spark/Azure/GCP jobs (partitioning, caching).  
- **Transformation errors** â†’ Add unit tests and data validation checks.  

### **Business Logic Issues**
- **Incorrect metric calculations** â†’ Implement data quality checks using Great Expectations or dbt tests.  
- **Unexpected data spikes/drops** â†’ Set up anomaly detection with alerts.  

---

## 5. Next Steps
1. **Set up alerts & dashboards** for monitoring.  
2. **Write run books** for investor pipelines.  
3. **Test failure scenarios** (e.g., missing data, schema drift).  
4. **Refine on-call schedule** based on team feedback.  

This plan ensures smooth operations, accountability, and quick issue resolution. ðŸš€
